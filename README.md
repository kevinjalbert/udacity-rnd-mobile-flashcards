# Mobile Flashcards

## Technical Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

### Running

1. Install everything via `yarn`.
2. Run the iOS simulator `yarn run ios` (technically android via `yarn run android` would work -- but it is less battle tested).

## Features

- Ability to create decks
- Ability to add cards to decks
- Ability to quiz yourself on a deck
- A daily notification at 8:00pm to take a quiz (if you have not yet)

## Future work

- Delete/edit decks
- Delete/edit cards
