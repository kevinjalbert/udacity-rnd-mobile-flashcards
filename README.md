## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

### Prerequisites

### Installing

The following will install all the required dependencies:

```
yarn
```

### Running

Both iOS and Android will work, although the iOS version has been better battle-tested and is the preferred platform.

For iOS:

```
yarn run ios
```

For Android:

```
yarn run android
```

### Linting

[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) are used for this project. You can run them via:

```
yarn run lint
```
